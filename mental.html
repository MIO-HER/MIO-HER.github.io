								<h2>How Hmong Culture Shapes Pick-Me Mentalities in Women</h2>
								<!-- <p>My first studio in Minneapolis.</p> -->
							</header>
							<div class="info">
								<span class="date"><span class="month">Mar</span> <span class="day">31st</span><span class="year">, 2024</span></span>

								Historically, Hmong traditions have emphasized the development of life through marriage and the creation of a family. Platforms like Asian Avenue and Asiantown have become resources to socialize and connect with people across the country. During their high school years, they connected, arranged meetings, and sometimes even got married. It is common for girls to marry at a very young age, often without a job, diploma, or independent living skills. Their work focused on domestic tasks such as cooking and cleaning, where men were often the main providers and networks of the community.<br>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								Women, who didn't work and were homemakers, were often dependent on men for financial support. Social status in society is associated with family and participation in cultural events, and those who do not have family ties or do not participate in social events are looked down upon.<br>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								Gender dynamics further maintained traditional roles, with women typically taking on responsibilities such as cooking and serving during gatherings, while men had decision-making authority. Within the conservative boundaries of Hmong culture, social activities and drinking are not encouraged.<br>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								With the development of social norms, opportunities to meet potential partners have expanded beyond traditional channels. However, traces of past expectations still exist, and those who remain single after a certain age are labeled as "leftovers" and face social pressures. Traditionally, men had the power to choose marriage partners, so women looked to them for validation and sometimes engaged in behaviors such as humiliating other women or competing for men's attention, rather than accepting their inherent worth and independence.<br>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								We find ourselves in an age where it is increasingly recognized that not everyone wants marriage or parenthood. The global community is struggling against overpopulation and resource strain, especially for families with limited financial resources and large numbers of children. It emphasizes the importance of nurturing strong female leaders who are empowered to make independent decisions, which boosts their self-confidence.<br>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								Women must embrace their authentic selves regardless of societal pressures. This includes connecting with and offering support to other women, and finding fulfillment and purpose from within, rather than seeking external validation. The priority is to stand up for personal needs and stay true to values ​​without compromising on pleasing others.<br>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								Prioritizing their desires and goals before needing external approval is essential. Developing diverse and respectful relationships that value people for who they are promotes personal growth and fulfillment. By focusing on self-awareness, self-acceptance, and empowerment, people can avoid behaviors rooted in seeking validation and foster healthier, more enriching connections.</p>
